        // 1. Each player takes turn to choose a number from 1-11
        // 2. Whoever that has the higher sum wins
        // 3. If a number is dealt already, that number cannot be dealt again. (hint: use Set<Integer> to keep track
        // 4. Print Each player's sum of numbers, numbers they were dealt, each turn
        //    hint: create another Player class, use List<Integer> to store the numbers
        // 5. The game ends when all of the numbers 1-11 run out
        // 6. Show which player wins
        // Next week, we'll go over the answers
